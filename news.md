**Default Episode Status**: 
We recently fixed this feature so you need  to:
- Edit your shows and set the default status to wanted instead of skipped (if you want unaired episodes to be downloaded)
- Set the ones that were marked skipped before that to wanted.

When adding a show you would be asked for two status: already aired episodes and unaired episodes.
